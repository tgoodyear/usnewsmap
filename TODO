History To DO List:

Guys
 
Great meeting. Claudio and Sergio were very impressed. The App looks great. Go team! Great job.
 
Here is what needs to happen next:
1.       Visualize the number of hits per location with a changing color scale on the marker
a.       During playback it will be so cool to watch the color change on the markers!
2.       Hover over the location marker and provide number of hits and city
3.       Option to “fuzzy” or “literal” search
4.       Two things they are sending us
a.       Search phases – “creek Indians” was an example
b.      Frequency ratios (i.e. number of mentions per edition) they want to see
5.       Find a way to have the image of the newspaper page pop up instead of the OCR text
6.       Make it look awesome with branding & instructions. GTRI  needs to link to something that can contact us.
7.       Where are we going to host this?
 
On the population project:
1.       Trevor is tracking down the data on PASTEC. We will go from there.
 
Thanks again for all your hard work on this,
Amy
