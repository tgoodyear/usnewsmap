Note/ reminder on how markers work:

	My cheat to get markers to work was that I would only give the map one marker per city.
	When someone clicked on the marker, the code would then grab the individual newspapers from a secondary data structure. 
	That secondary data structure is what the timeline gets and where we get access to the text.
